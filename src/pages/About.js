      <p className="about-description">
        I'm Kenton Tang, currently on an exchange program at the University of Pennsylvania, pursuing a BSc in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. My academic journey has fueled my passion for Software Engineering, and I'm particularly excited about the theoretical foundations of Machine Learning and the application of Natural Language Processing. I also have interest in the application of computational skills in finance.
      </p>
      <p className="about-description">
        With a solid academic background, including courses in Data Structures and Algorithms, Data Science, and NLP, I am eager to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. I'm currently looking for an internship role in Software Engineering, where I can contribute, learn, and grow.
